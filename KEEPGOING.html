         YOURSELF!</h1>
         <p style="background-color: darkred;">Loving oneself is looked at as being selfish. Most also look at it as an excuse to
        go bankrupt. However, with <i>Just Keep Going</i> we teach one to love oneself and put others first at the same time,
        and also be economical with the self-love.<br>
        As we go ahead, we request of you to offer some personal details:
